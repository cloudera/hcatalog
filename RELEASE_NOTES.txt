These notes are for HCatalog 0.4.0 release.

Highlights
==========
 
HCatalog is a table management and storage management layer for Hadoop that
enables users with different data processing tools – Pig, MapReduce, and Hive,
to easily share data on the grid. HCatalog’s table abstraction presents users
with a relational view of data in the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS)
and ensures that users need not worry about where or in what format their data
is stored – RCFile format, text files, sequence files.

System Requirements

1. Java 1.6.x or newer, preferably from Sun. Set JAVA_HOME to the root of your
   Java installation
2. Ant build tool, version 1.8 or higher:  http://ant.apache.org - to build
   source only
3. This release is compatible with Hadoop 1.0.1.
4. This release is compatible with Pig 0.8.1 and Pig 0.9.1 or 0.9.2.
